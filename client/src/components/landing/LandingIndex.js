                üë©üèª‚Äçüíª I'm Jenny! üéì I graduated from the University of Virginia with a <b> Bachelor of Science Degree </b> and gained <b> professional skills </b> as a nurse for four years. Throughout undergrad I stayed on the Dean‚Äôs List, aka I maxed out on credits every semester and maintained a high GPA. As a nurse, I was awarded multiple Spirit Awards, by colleagues and patients, for my noteworthy <b> enthusiasm to help others </b> and promote a positive team culture.
                ü©∫  When I started classes at one of the top 10 Family Nurse Practitioner Programs in the US, I realized that even advanced practice nursing would not include the level of creative, dynamic problem solving I hoped to pursue. I explored my options and ultimately found excitement in software engineering.
