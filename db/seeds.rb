water = Enneadrink.create(drink: "water", number: 1, title: "the good", emoji: "üåä",
    about: "Waters are attracted to and value goodness.
    They believe life is about doing your best, setting high standards and goals and living up to them. Many Waters report growing up in families with high standards and the pressure to perform, often being criticized for their mistakes. As a result, they developed a fear of failure and an incessant need to be perfect and good enough, unconsciously seeking to earn the love and acceptance of their caregivers. They become model children who are motivated to ‚Äòbe good,‚Äô ‚Äòtry harder‚Äô and ‚Äòget it right.‚Äô As adults, Waters are sometimes described as obsessive compulsive, always trying to perfect and make things better. There is always room for improvement for Waters. They are critical toward others‚Äô mistakes and especially critical toward their own. Their drive for perfection often leads them to reform what is broken and can be a blessing. However, it can also be a burden, leading to a deep sense of anger and guilt.",
    strengths: "Waters live with conviction, are bold and courageous. 
    Healthy Waters are willing to take a stand and sacrifice themselves for what‚Äôs right, and keep the mission moving forward; they are sensible, responsible, ethical, self- disciplined, just, fair, tolerant of failure‚Äîboth theirs and others‚Äîand accepting of their limits and losses.",
    weaknesses: "For Waters, the besetting struggle is anger. 
    The underlying emotion Waters are trying to conquer is guilt. Waters often carry a suppressed anger because nothing is ever good enough‚Äî including and especially themselves. This anger is driven by an exaggerated sense of guilt and a feeling of not measuring up, which leads Waters to be very hard on themselves. Few casual observers would suspect how much Waters are suffering from the attacks of their Inner Critic. This is not only how Waters tend to relate to themselves, but to others, through performance and criticism."

tea = Enneadrink.create(drink: "tea", number: 2, title: "the loving", emoji: "üßã",
    about: "Teas see the world in terms of loving and serving people.
    Life is about being generous and meeting the needs of others. It‚Äôs possible that Teas grew up in an environment where they had to step up at a young age and learn how to take care of themselves and others emotionally and/or physically. They may have had to provide emotional support for their parents and siblings, sometimes becoming the parent in the family. This means that Teas had to grow up fast. As a result, Teas cultivated a gift for empathy and moving toward others in love and service. However, the dark side of Teas is a desperate need to be needed. This is the essence of their inner battle with shame and pride.",
    strengths: "Teas are thoughtful, caring, and empathetic. 
    Healthy Teas are in touch with their own emotional and spiritual needs and are willing to be vulnerable before others. They express appreciation, generosity, humility, affection, encouragement, compassion, and others-orientedness.",
    weaknesses: "Teas battle shame and a sense of worthlessness if they aren‚Äôt needed by others. 
    Ironically, this leads to a form of pride that unconsciously motivates Teas in the sense that their service of others can be motivated by their own self-interest and need for approval. This can lead to people-pleasing, over-attachment to people, and the fear of man. Unhealthy Teas also deny their own needs. They are energized by meeting others‚Äô needs but fear having the tables turned since it compromises their survival strategy of being the caregiver."
)

sparkling = Enneadrink.create(drink: "sparkling water", number: 3, title: "the effective", emoji: "‚ú®",
    about: "Sparkling Waters see the world in terms of accomplishments and achievements. 
    Life is about being productive, getting things done, accomplishing goals, and winning. Above all, Sparkling Waters want to be the best at whatever they do, basically doing whatever it takes to shine. It‚Äôs possible that Sparkling Waters grew up in an environment where there was a high value on looking presentable and put together or maybe there was an unusual emphasis on excellence and being the best. There was a greater emphasis on how you looked and how you performed and less emphasis on who you were. As a result, Sparkling Waters learned to use popularity and the image of success as a way to feel loved and accepted rather than receiving love through vulnerability and trust. Sparkling Waters are driven by 3 C‚Äôs: Competency, Comparison, and Competition. This can lead Sparkling Waters to accomplish great things, but it can also lead to self-promotion and exaggerated feelings of shame.",
    strengths: "Sparkling Waters are effective, competent, and adaptable. 
    Healthy Sparkling Waters are driven by love instead of shame. They are authentic, gracious, humble, hard-working yet restful, tolerant of their failures, accepting of their limits and losses, and interested in others.",
    weaknesses: "For Sparkling Waters, the besetting struggle is deceit or projecting a false image. 
    The underlying emotion they are trying to resolve is shame. Whereas Waters desire to be perfect, Sparkling Waters desire to look perfect. Unhealthy Sparkling Waters relate through performance and perception, striving to be or at least be seen as good enough. The question Sparkling Waters are asking is, 'Who am I if I‚Äôm not seen as successful?' Sparkling Waters tend to shine on the outside in whatever they do, while their inner life remains disconnected. Preoccupied with speed and efficiency in accomplishing their goals, Sparkling Waters rarely slow down and press inward to get in touch with their emotions."

espresso = Enneadrink.create(drink: "espresso", number: 4, title: "the original", emoji: "üöÇ",
    about: "Espressos are sometimes called 'the romantics of the Enneadrinks.'
    They see the world in terms of beauty, the arts, and authentic expression. They value being original and unique. Espressos are also very aware of their emotional states. They often express their feelings in dance, music, painting, acting, and literature. Many Espressos report growing up with a sense of loss, and therefore they carry a deep sense that something is always missing. There might have been some form of abandonment or neglect, emotional and/or physical, from their childhood or the loss of someone really important to them. They may have interpreted their experience to mean that something was wrong with them, that they weren‚Äôt wanted or weren‚Äôt special enough to be noticed. To compensate, Espressos learned to present themselves as unique and extra special, so that others would notice them and affirm their worth.",
    strengths: "Espressos express beauty, creativity, and emotional honesty.
    Healthy Espressos are not only in touch with their own emotions but with the emotional state of others; they are compassionate, empathetic, great listeners, sensitive, impressionable, passionate, romantic, elegant, witty, imaginative, self-expressive, creative, inspired, not self-absorbed or self-pitying, and emotionally strong for themselves and others.",
    weaknesses: "For Espressos, the besetting struggle is envy.
    At some level, Espressos believe they are missing something that other people seem to have. Naturally, this can lead to be envious of others. The driving emotion beneath the surface is shame and a low view of self. Unhealthy Espressos are known to give themselves to a critical, melancholy, depressed, self-loathing spirit. While they don‚Äôt like it, they can easily get comfortable in a dark place and wear that for their identity. Their own darkness becomes another means of being different and trying to overcome shame. This is a self-destructive pattern."

latte = Enneadrink.create(drink: "latte", number: 5, title: "the wise", emoji: "üåå",
    about: "Lattes see the world in terms of reason, knowledge, learning, and storing up information.
    Life is about having insights, learning about things, and seeing how everything fits together. They tend to be highly innovative and inventive. Many Lattes report growing up in a disruptive, somewhat intrusive environment. It‚Äôs possible that they were interrupted a lot and also emotionally and/or physically neglected. As a result, Lattes learned that it was safer to do everything alone, and they created an intellectual world where they could function and feel safe. They live a compartmentalized life, detached from the their emotions. If you ask Lattes what they feel, they will tell you what they think.",
    strengths: "Lattes are ever fascinated with the world. 
    Healthy Lattes are studious, perceptive, pioneering, innovative, focused, observant, curious, insightful, objective, understanding, playful, compassionate, and know how to love others with their information and knowledge rather than hide in it. Because they love to observe, they make wonderful listeners and counselors.",
    weaknesses: "Lattes perceive the world as a dangerous place and battle an underlying emotion of fear. 
    Their besetting sin is greed. This is not a monetary greed; rather, it is the lack of ability to be open and generous with one‚Äôs self. The Lattes' defense mechanism is to hide inside their wealth of knowledge and live inside their minds. Lattes are afraid of their feelings, so they hide in their thoughts. They‚Äôre afraid of being vulnerable and known, so they withhold their true selves. Unhealthy Lattes can be argumentative, high strung, cynical, reclusive, even nihilistic."
)

lemon = Enneadrink.create(drink: "lemon water", number: 6, title: "the loyal", emoji: "üçã",
    about: "Lemon Waters value being faithful, reliable, prepared, dutiful, responsible, and conscientious.
    Above all, they value safety, security, and stability. Many Lemon Waters report growing up in unstable homes, where the emotional atmosphere was up and down. It‚Äôs possible that the authoritative figures in their lives didn‚Äôt use their power in a way that made them feel safe. They might have been emotionally unreliable, overly protective, or even abusive. Basically, they were inconsistent in their care. As a result, Lemon Waters struggle to trust authority and learned they need to try to win over the authoritative figures in their life in order to feel protected or oppose them in order to protect themselves.",
    strengths: "Lemon Waters are faithful, steadfast, and loyal. 
    Healthy Lemon Waters are a stabilizing presence. They have the ability to ground people in reality and draw out their emotions. They are faithful, reliable, hard-working, courageous, leaders, self-expressive, vigilant, secure, charming, funny, and affectionate.",
    weaknesses: "The underlying emotion Lemon Waters are trying to overcome is fear. 
    Their besetting struggle is anxiety. They are the most anxious type of all the Enneadrinks. They live in their heads and let their thoughts run away with them. They tend to worry about what they‚Äôre going to worry about. It‚Äôs not just that they struggle to trust others, but Lemon Waters really struggle to trust themselves. Lemon Waters are plagued with self-doubt. They tirelessly look for some kind of structure to hide in, an environment that will reassure them and make them feel safe and secure and stable. The questions their soul is asking are, Where am I? Am I safe? Unhealthy Lemon Waters are suspicious of others, especially authority."
)

smoothie = Enneadrink.create(drink: "smoothie", number: 7, title: "the joyful", emoji:"üåÑ",
    about: "Smoothies are all about fun and joy and excitement.
    They are probably the most upbeat, extroverted, outgoing type of the Enneadrinks. They light up a room with their presence. There is a glow and positive energy that emanates from them. Many Smoothies report carrying a deep childhood wound, which they try to avoid at all costs through the pursuit of new experiences, staying active, and entertainment. Their strategy is to repress their traumatic experiences from childhood and paint their life story in positive colors, even when the scenario was anything but beautiful. Appearing to be full of heart, Smoothies actually operate from the head. They carefully think through their lives so that every day will promise as much fun and as little pain as possible.",
    strengths: "Smoothies bring joy and spark into people's lives. 
    Healthy Smoothies are excitable, spontaneous, curious, optimistic, eager, outgoing, adventurous, talkative, appreciative, bountiful, thoughtful, accomplished, versatile, receptive, grateful, passionate, celebratory, and most importantly satisfied, content, and at peace with their circumstances and life.",
    weaknesses: "Smoothies are driven by an underlying fear that goes back to their childhood. 
    Their coping strategy is to have as much entertainment as possible, which is why their besetting struggle is gluttony. Smoothies are prone to constant stimulation and consumption as a way of distracting themselves from an inner anxiety. This is their defense strategy against their emotional pain. They 'gobble up' every experience but are always left hungry for more. Thus, they are always looking for the next thing or the perfect combination of things that will heal them and make them truly happy. They tend to be thrill seekers. Their avoidance of pain and endless hunger for more make them prone to various additions, including chronic anxiety. Unhealthy Smoothies would rather keep relationships on the surface because it would be too painful to know their whole story."

juice = Enneadrink.create(drink: "juice", number: 8, title: "the powerful", emoji: "üçä",
    about: "Juices are powerful personalities.
    They have a very intense and commanding presence. Juices endeavor to be strong, independent, straightforward, assertive persons who use their strength and influence to make the world a more just place. Juices see the world in black and white‚Äî it‚Äôs either the greatest or the worst idea of all time, right or wrong, true or false, friend or enemy. Juices are energized by disagreement and don‚Äôt like to admit their faults, for this is a sign of weakness. Many Juices report being taken advantage of or treated unfairly in their childhood. As a result,they learned to develop an image of power and strength, believing weakness to be unacceptable. They learned to dominate lest they be dominated. This is their defense strategy.",
    strengths: "Juices are strong and courageous and take a bold stand against injustice.
    Healthy Juices are big-hearted, merciful, forbearing, leaders, determined, resourceful, pragmatic, honorable, heroic, empowering, generous, initiating, decisive, vulnerable, accepting of their weaknesses, and leading with a limp.",
    weaknesses: "The underlying emotion Juices are trying to conquer is guilt, feeling as though they aren‚Äôt good enough. 
    Their survival strategy is to be powerful and take control. This leads to their besetting struggle with lust‚Äîthe passion for power. They become very angry, confrontational and aggressive and throw their weight around. People can feel dominated, controlled, and belittled by Juices, but rarely do Juices notice how they make others feel. They can be emotional bulldozers."

hotcocoa = Enneadrink.create(drink: "hot cocoa", number: 9, title: "the peaceful", emoji: "üç´",
    about: "Hot Cocoas value peace, harmony, unity, and wholeness.
    For a Hot Cocoa, life is about bringing people together and being at peace personally and interpersonally. Hot Cocoas tend to go with the flow and want to avoid rocking the boat, i.e., they don‚Äôt want to assert themselves out of a fear of conflict. Many Hot Cocoas recall memories of being overlooked and neglected as a child. Their voice didn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs also reported that many Hot Cocoas grew up in families with unhealthy patterns of dealing with conflict. For some, conflict was pushed down, ‚Äúswept under the rug,‚Äù and avoided at all costs. For others, conflict was processed through anger, verbal, or even physical assault. As a result, Hot Cocoas developed a conflict within themselves, struggling to follow their intuition and be bold.",
    strengths: "Hot Cocoas are peaceful, comforting, and reassuring. 
    Healthy Hot Cocoas are patient, steady, receptive, relaxed, agreeable, comforting, self-aware, dynamic, proactive, healing, natural, imaginative, serene, engaged, and passionate. They make excellent mediators, having the ability to be objective and see all sides of an issue. They are essential to a world of conflict and pain.",
    weaknesses: "For Hot Cocoas, the besetting struggle is sloth- not in terms of physical laziness but relational negligence. 
    Hot Cocoas tend to check out emotionally and relationally. When they‚Äôre unhealthy, they will run from all conflict, and their defense strategy is to shut down and withdraw. They will no longer be fully present. They can lose themselves and retreat into inoculating activity, like watching TV, playing games on their phone, checking social media, doing busy work, distracting themselves from their emotional needs and the needs of others. This creates a deep sense of guilt in Hot Cocoas, which is the underlying emotion they are trying to overcome."
