Juices endeavor to be strong, independent, straightforward, assertive persons who use their strength and influence to make the world a more just place. Juices see the world in black and white— it’s either the greatest or the worst idea of all time, right or wrong, true or false, friend or enemy. Juices are energized by disagreement and don’t like to admit their faults, for this is a sign of weakness. Many Juices report being taken advantage of or treated unfairly in their childhood. As a result,they learned to develop an image of power and strength, believing weakness to be unacceptable. They learned to dominate lest they be dominated. This is their defense strategy."], ["strengths", "Juices are strong and courageous and take a bold stand against injustice.\n    Healthy Juices are big-hearted, merciful, forbearing, leaders, determined, resourceful, pragmatic, honorable, heroic, empowering, generous, initiating, decisive, vulnerable, accepting of their weaknesses, and leading with a limp."], ["weaknesses", "The underlying emotion Juices are trying to conquer is guilt, feeling as though they aren’t good enough. \n    Their survival strategy is to be powerful and take control. This leads to their besetting struggle with lust—the passion for power. They become very angry, confrontational and aggressive and throw their weight around. People can feel dominated, controlled, and belittled by Juices, but rarely do Juices notice how they make others feel. They can be emotional bulldozers."], ["created_at", "2022-03-02 04:15:46.811225"], ["updated_at", "2022-03-02 04:15:46.811225"]]
